questions:
- question: Why am I being summoned by the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services?
  answer: It has been alleged that an animal injured a person or another animal, and/or
    caused property damage within the City of Los Angeles.  The Department believes
    you are either the victim of such an incident, or the owner of the animal involved
    in the incident(s), or a witness to the incident(s).  You are being summoned to
    appear and testify at a hearing regarding the incident(s).  Per Los Angeles Municipal
    Code Section 53.34.4, the Department must conduct a hearing to determine whether
    the animal poses a threat to public safety.

- question: What is the purpose of the hearing?
  answer: The hearing is a semi-judicial proceeding – something of an informal trial.  It
    aims solely to gather evidence to ultimately determine whether the animal in question
    can safely be maintained in the City of Los Angeles.  The hearing is only concerned
    with public safety and welfare – it does not address potential claims for money
    damages or other matters that would be reserved for civil litigation.  The hearing
    is a public proceeding – anyone may attend and the audio of the proceedings is
    recorded.

- question: Where and when are hearings held?
  answer: 'The date and time of your hearing should be listed on your summons.  All
    hearings are held downtown at the Department of Animal Services Headquarters:
    221 N. Figueroa St., Suite 600, Los Angeles, CA 90012.  Suite 600 is on the 6th
    floor.  Plan to arrive 15 minutes in advance of your hearing time to allow time
    to check-in with Department staff.'
- question: Where should I park?
  answer: |-
    Parking is available in the building’s garage for a $28 daily max.  This garage is at the back of the building; to access it via GPS, navigate to 250 N. Fremont Ave.

    More inexpensive parking options may be available nearby.  Additional garages within a short walk can be found at 717 W Temple St, or 123 S. Figueroa St. (Promenade Towers).  Metered street parking is also available in the area.
